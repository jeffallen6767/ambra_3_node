## ambra_3_node

Implement a 3-level node structure of parents and children using JavaScript. 

Each node should store the parent name and a list of children. 

Create some node data, then using this, represent the data as a tree structure on a web page. 

You should be able to collapse and expand the tree structure by clicking node names on the web page. 

You are allowed to use plain JavaScript or your favorite library.
